# Instagram Clone with Vue 3

Here's a _not-so-little but also not-so-detailed_ Instagram clone app with Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS on Twitch! You can check out [my channel by clicking here](https://www.twitch.tv/eggsydev/).

- Take a look at the demo: [https://vue3-instagram-clone.netlify.app/](https://vue3-instagram-clone.netlify.app/)
- Watch me building the app: [https://www.twitch.tv/eggsydev/videos#:~:text=Coding](https://www.twitch.tv/eggsydev/videos#:~:text=Coding)

### Notes

- The app has **homepage**, **messages**, **explore**, **activity**, **camera** and **profile** pages that are really similar to actual Instagram app (checkout screenshots).
- The app only uses static data from picsum, lorem etc., it's dynamic at some extend, there's no data fetching at all.
